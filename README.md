During this project, I faced challenges with Mongoose relationships, especially getting .populate() to work due to mismatched model names and references. I also struggled with showing backend data in the React table until I properly seeded the database and aligned my API fetch logic. Debugging these issues helped me better understand backendâ€“frontend integration and MongoDB schema design.
